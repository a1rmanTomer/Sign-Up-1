# Info
This is my first HTML + CSS project ever!
When trying to learn WEB DEV via YouTube I suddenly came across [AsmrProg](https://www.youtube.com/@AsmrProg)'s channel and started watching some of his ASMR Coding.
Immediately falling in love with Web-Dev, I started working on this project as a side-by-side window to his [final work](https://youtu.be/mW_XpjbFsm4?si=mO15gYLhK_VED3aR) and tried to recreate It as close as possible using what i just learnt before-hand!

Sooooo, enjoy my final work! (altho its not as identical)


## BTW

AsmrProg, if ur coming across this page, please be sure to check my other repos as I'm willing to recreate more of ur work as my Web-Dev training!

Leave a like if u liked it <33333333

TYSM - Tomer.
